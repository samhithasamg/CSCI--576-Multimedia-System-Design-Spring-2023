Example images, which are in the one channel or grayscale format. 
  They are as follows with dimensions and brief description
   image1-onechannel.rgb -> 352x288 shows a foreman
   image2-onechannel.rgb -> 352x288 shows a golf playing scene
   image3-onechannel.rgb -> 352x288 shows a man in swimming pool
   image4-onechannel.rgb -> 352x288 shows a construction site

You can use the same reference code we provided to display images.You will need to populate all three channels with the same data read from the one channel file to display the imaeg. Alternatively, we have also provided threechannel.rgb images, where are channels are duplicates if you choose to use these. For the programming assignment on compression, you will need to work with just one channel, but you may need three channels for display reasons.
